        Ocean Beach is one of the places that I frequent the most. <br>
        It's practically my backyard.<br>
        In this picture, you can see the Camera Obscura near the Cliff House called Giant Camera. <br>
        I loved the graffiti of the three butts. <br>
        It was very hilarious because prior to that someone had spray painted only one butt, but it was erased. <br>
        I hope they don't paint over it.
